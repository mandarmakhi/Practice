"Well, the writers and producers outdone themselves.
They started with a good idea, intriguing characters and an elaborate plot.
By the end of season 2 it became apparent they could not drag this anymore.
Season 3 was just a \"remake\" of season 1 but, my God, season 4 is an awful soap opera...seems almost like a \"filler\" season...no actual plot, no actual action...you could skip straight to episode 7 if u want and still..you wouldnt miss a thing.
Hire better writers, because this cast is impeccable."

"I really only write reviews when I feel like a show is getting way too much of praise or way too little.
I love heist movies/series. So it makes sense that I would finally end up watching this one. But let me warn you, other heist lovers, this is a soap opera not a heist story. I'm 6 episodes in now (probably wont be a 7th) and it's just annoying the hell out of me. The characters are unbelievably stupid, doing things that even people like us, who aren't actually career criminals, would never do. And what is the reason for this stupidity? LOVE! Or, maybe I should say crushes? Criminals loving criminals, criminals loving hostages and every other combination. These are people who have lost it all and want everything, and then drop the whole plan and do ridiculous thing when a girl/boy smiles at them sweetly.
I know that I'm very late to reviewing this thing (as it already has multiple seasons) but if my words can save someone 6 hours of their life, it will be worth it. I sadly won't be getting that time back.
it's a 2/10 stars for me (but I put 3/10 believing that people are more likely to ignore the very low score reviews, and I aim to protect you people) :D
Take care! :)"

"Well to be honest very disappointed in the season, I was waiting for this season since the end of season 3So we started the season inside the bank, ended inside the bank.. and what's the progress? Dead NairobiThat's about it, and I made my peace with Nairobi since last season dead, for some reason they decided to bring her back to life to kill her again at the end of this seasonPunch of hugs, cries and completely unnecessary past scenes that were extremely boringGandia standing in the middle of the hallway surrounded by 4 of them shooting automatic weapons and he still stand, breaks out of his cuffs and leave Rio as if he is going to a picnicSo if you look logically at the season, you gained absolutely nothing from 8 episodes, just unnecessary stretch filled with unnecessary events, scenes and past scenesAn idiot decided to help Gandia out the assassin! As if he didnt know how to break out of his cuffs alone! Then he is back in command again! Forgotten and forgiving! Coffin that would stop an assault! A police man that made no sense after jumping off the 4th storey building to agree to join them and giving them all the Intel they need! And a crazy detective who figures it all out from scenes that were put on repeat that she did not see!End of the day.. very disappointing, stretched out and unnecessary season where they could have ended the story there but yet to wait for another season \"maybe\"In my opinion they could break lisbon out in the first 2 episodes, had the Gandia drama in 1 episode, dropped the bomb over few different episodes insead of cramping them in 1 and ended the story thereAnd what to expect next season? Another stretched out season to finish a series that could have easily be finished this season"
"I had heard so many good things about this show. The most watched show in Europe, Spain's biggest ever viewing figures etc. Then from a promising start the program just gets more and more ridiculous. Now I know it's just apiece of entertaining fictional drama but half the skill in making a show like this is to get the audience to think as far fetched as the plot is a part of you would like to think it could be done.The show makes the perpetrators and the police look as stupid and as dumb as each other. You get robbers falling in love and having sex, robbers having sex with hostages and wait for it the mastermind behind the robbery having sex with the chief inspector in charge of the police operation. The plot has more holes than a second hand dart board. Only the production value and some good set pierces save this from one star. 3/10"

"A band of robbers, lead by a man known simply as 'the Professor', infiltrate and rob the Spanish National Mint. They appear to bungle it, ending up holed up in the Mint with 67 hostages. But it's all part of the Professor's plan. If it succeeds, they'll make off with over $2 billion Euros.Entertaining, initially, and could have been a masterpiece. The initial plot - the plan to secure the Mint and make off with over $2 billion Euros - was very clever and intriguing. It was also engaging: you got to know the individual characters of the heisters, as well as who they were up against. From here on I expected a taught, gritty battle of wits and wills between the robbers and the police.Unfortunately, that didn't happen. Instead of being tight, the plot diverged into silly escapades. One escapade lead to another: robber has to fix some error, fixes it, unwittingly causes another issue, now has to fix that, rinse and repeat. What's worse, the errors, solutions and escapades were incredibly implausible, just being antics for action sake.In addition, having established their characters in the first few episodes, the robbers then do several things counter to their characters. It was as if the writers wrote each scene independent of what had happened before. It could not have been more random if they brought in a different writer for each episode, and told them not to read the scripts of the previous episodes.The further into the series one went, the worse it got. During the first season the good, clever plot developments generally outweighed the random, implausible, stupid ones. By Season Two it was open season, with dumb stuff being the norm. The dumb plot developments became predictable, eg you have a situation where a character has a choice and the logical thing, the thing people would do 100% of the time in real life, is to do A. However, A would mean the series ends, so the character does B, and the series continues.So the plot only makes sense if you're mind-bogglingly stupid.By the end I just wanted it to be over, so my intelligence would no longer be insulted. And yet it still got drawn out, by about 2-3 episodes too many.And apparently there's a Season 3 in the works. Considering how it ended, not sure how that's possible, but the producers did manage to turn what should have been a 8-or-so episode mini-series into a 2-season, 22-episode series."

During the heist they fight among themselves? Forced soap opera level drama in a heist story. Dumbest series ever!"
"I've started watching this as the idea sounded interesting with quite some potential when seeing a series filmed in Europe. But, my God, the characters do loose touch with reality and common sense already during season one. By mid season two I could no longer see this. In all honesty, do we really have to have the \"bad guys\" completely useless when enforcing something, taking revenge or even facing each other? Do we really have all the women in this series falling flat on their backs, in love with the perps? And does the Spanish Police, in real life, act like this? Meaning...will an arrest happen when the perp surrenders as he gets bored from being caught 10x? Another soap opera that disappoints more by creating actually an expectation to get something different..."
"The basic idea of holding mint with hostage was fine and some excitement generated at times and some style. But that's it !!! A low grade stuff besides thatBad direction and complete lack of attention to details. Just some examples:1. Flaw in philosophy: The group is shown as quite innocent who only steals with the justification that big banks steal too. With professor trying to kill inspector's mother, the inspector coming out of coma and group shooting recklessly on police who is doing their job, and then keeping simple people hostage, where is that innocence??2. Technical Flaws:
Biggest one: While the professor is so super intelligent, police seems to be utter stupid that knowing such a big some of money is being stolen, police doesn't have any helicopter on stand-by, nor they lock down the city knowing group is exiting,main inspector taking her boyfriend to crime scene and within the barricaded areamain inspector dating around in an intense operation of 5 daysthe group seems to have everything inside the factory: plush sofas, coffins, candles to decorate the deadhow the hell did they leave the city and the country is never shown with police knowing they are on the run (I guess somehow one has to assume with the great brilliance of the professor, they had a way and the police is anyway stupid)In open firing inside the mint which is happening in an aisle of say 3 meter width, while commandos have shield (and hoping they are experts in encounter) and the group doesn't, not even a single heist member is injured !!!!! Are you kidding me?3. Ridiculous acting and presentation of main characters:
The main inspector in charge of such a big operation shown to be highly unprofessional, weak in character and stupid to take on the criminal alone every timeMost of the gang which is supposedly from not so well off background, has great personality, attitude, drink and eat like they have been taught etiquette, even snobbishness at timesAnd now the funny part: The main inspector being a clear suspect in being accomplice, somehow lives on the life peacefully with no investigation or charges brought on and then leaves the country to Philippines !!!!"

"This series gives a lot of big messages.
First of all, Dali masks are not an ordinary choice. Dali is a genius painter who inherited life that is contrary to popular morality and common customs. He has never accepted the imperatives from the society and the right to wrong moral codes. The masks represent this irregularity.Red overalls represent socialism. The wearers are socialist comrades and fighting. Mint and cops represent capitalism. In capitalism money sets everything. Even morals will set money. So when someone attacks the money, those people are declared bad. When attacked by money, capitalism is waging a war against the attackers with its armed and visual mechanisms.The professor is symbolizing the scientific perspective and accounting. After all, scientific thinking and accountability overcome all kinds of problems. But love succumbs.I have not seen such meaningful socialism for a long time. Moreover, Salvador Dali's tactic was used in the series. You think you are watching the events, but every time you have a deep meaning and message. Ciao Bella is the symbol of socialism.Fabulous work. It's not just a movie or a script. It is a wonderful work as a philosophy. There is a great slap in the capitalist system. 10/10"

From the logic behind the robbery that \"we are not stealing from people but just printing our own money\" is also one of the dumbest logic applied in the history of heist movies/series. Have they even heard of a word \"inflation\"?.

"The real heist is by the writers who keep stalling for more time with more nonsense episodes while Netflix prints money.First season had promise. But shortly into the season characters start making flatout preternatural connections especially inspector Raquel. Which she corrects by missing the most obvious ones. 6 episodes in... coming out of a hazy binge stupor because your wife keeps pressing next... you realize... wait... they expect us to believe all this happens in 3 days. People recover from gunshot wounds as if they were scratches. Of course, everyone forgives and forgets. Love stories happen when someones sneezes. Investigations are mobilized across all of Spain with such immediacy and the realtime forensics of our dreams. Then the typical \"we have the all important lab results - i knew he was the guy - but your voicemail is now full - and I'm the jaded drunk lover about to have an accident/coma routine - let me call your selectively Alzheimers mother.\" If only his twin would show up.... Professor Palpatine's plan then everything would be proceeding as he's forseen. If we still had TV guide this show would be on at 11 am after \"the View.\" I got fooled because they didn't shoot it in live camera format with dramatic face to face pauses, watery eyes, and breakaways to commercial (remember those). Music is pretty good. I can go on... but then I would be an accomplice perpetuating the real crime of taking your time with this show (like the writers!)Watch no more than two episodes to get the gist/hype then make your escape!"
"Like everything in this generation, I discovered this TV show through hype. It was going viral, on my Netflix home screen, on twitter, everywhere. So, I decided to give it a try. I feel disappointed I wasted my time on this show. I'm not a fan of fantasy shows like Spiderman, Superman, Batman etc. Honey Heist is a mirror image of super hero movies, difference being the crew here is a bunch of bad guys. I'm not a fan of fantasy shows because of the imbalance, one side is extremely strong, smart, has all the powers available right on time and other side is simply dumb. In this show too, it's the same, the cops are dumb and incompetent. The cops in this show have all the equipment, fancy gears, intelligence power, yet they screw up worse than a third world country cops, not once but multiple times, come on, are the Spanish cops really that bad? Could the makers not make is somewhat believable? The Royal Mint of Spain is under siege and the top cop is going on a dinner date? Having an affair with the main accused? Oh my, that is some level of soap opera right there. And to top it off they dragged what could have been a mini-series to 4 seasons. Learned my lesson, don't jump on the hype wagon, do your research before wasting time on something like this again."

If we still had TV guide this show would be on at 11 am after \"the View.\" I got fooled because they didn't shoot it in live camera format with dramatic face to face pauses, watery eyes, and breakaways to commercial (remember those). Music is pretty good. I can go on... but then I would be an accomplice perpetuating the real crime of taking your time with this show (like the writers!)Watch no more than two episodes to get the gist/hype then make your escape!"
"Like everything in this generation, I discovered this TV show through hype. It was going viral, on my Netflix home screen, on twitter, everywhere. So, I decided to give it a try. I feel disappointed I wasted my time on this show. I'm not a fan of fantasy shows like Spiderman, Superman, Batman etc. Honey Heist is a mirror image of super hero movies, difference being the crew here is a bunch of bad guys. I'm not a fan of fantasy shows because of the imbalance, one side is extremely strong, smart, has all the powers available right on time and other side is simply dumb. In this show too, it's the same, the cops are dumb and incompetent. The cops in this show have all the equipment, fancy gears, intelligence power, yet they screw up worse than a third world country cops, not once but multiple times, come on, are the Spanish cops really that bad? Could the makers not make is somewhat believable? The Royal Mint of Spain is under siege and the top cop is going on a dinner date? Having an affair with the main accused? Oh my, that is some level of soap opera right there. And to top it off they dragged what could have been a mini-series to 4 seasons. Learned my lesson, don't jump on the hype wagon, do your research before wasting time on something like this again."

They started with a good idea, intriguing characters and an elaborate plot.

Season 3 was just a \"remake\" of season 1 but, my God, season 4 is an awful soap opera...seems almost like a \"filler\" season...no actual plot, no actual action...you could skip straight to episode 7 if u want and still..you wouldnt miss a thing.

"I really only write reviews when I feel like a show is getting way too much of praise or way too little.
I love heist movies/series. So it makes sense that I would finally end up watching this one. But let me warn you, other heist lovers, this is a soap opera not a heist story. I'm 6 episodes in now (probably wont be a 7th) and it's just annoying the hell out of me. The characters are unbelievably stupid, doing things that even people like us, who aren't actually career criminals, would never do. And what is the reason for this stupidity? LOVE! Or, maybe I should say crushes? Criminals loving criminals, criminals loving hostages and every other combination. These are people who have lost it all and want everything, and then drop the whole plan and do ridiculous thing when a girl/boy smiles at them sweetly.
I know that I'm very late to reviewing this thing (as it already has multiple seasons) but if my words can save someone 6 hours of their life, it will be worth it. I sadly won't be getting that time back.
it's a 2/10 stars for me (but I put 3/10 believing that people are more likely to ignore the very low score reviews, and I aim to protect you people) :D
Take care! :)"

"Well to be honest very disappointed in the season, I was waiting for this season since the end of season 3So we started the season inside the bank, ended inside the bank.. and what's the progress? Dead NairobiThat's about it, and I made my peace with Nairobi since last season dead, for some reason they decided to bring her back to life to kill her again at the end of this seasonPunch of hugs, cries and completely unnecessary past scenes that were extremely boringGandia standing in the middle of the hallway surrounded by 4 of them shooting automatic weapons and he still stand, breaks out of his cuffs and leave Rio as if he is going to a picnicSo if you look logically at the season, you gained absolutely nothing from 8 episodes, just unnecessary stretch filled with unnecessary events, scenes and past scenesAn idiot decided to help Gandia out the assassin! As if he didnt know how to break out of his cuffs alone! Then he is back in command again! Forgotten and forgiving! Coffin that would stop an assault! A police man that made no sense after jumping off the 4th storey building to agree to join them and giving them all the Intel they need! And a crazy detective who figures it all out from scenes that were put on repeat that she did not see!End of the day.. very disappointing, stretched out and unnecessary season where they could have ended the story there but yet to wait for another season \"maybe\"In my opinion they could break lisbon out in the first 2 episodes, had the Gandia drama in 1 episode, dropped the bomb over few different episodes insead of cramping them in 1 and ended the story thereAnd what to expect next season? Another stretched out season to finish a series that could have easily be finished this season"
"I had heard so many good things about this show. The most watched show in Europe, Spain's biggest ever viewing figures etc. Then from a promising start the program just gets more and more ridiculous. Now I know it's just apiece of entertaining fictional drama but half the skill in making a show like this is to get the audience to think as far fetched as the plot is a part of you would like to think it could be done.The show makes the perpetrators and the police look as stupid and as dumb as each other. You get robbers falling in love and having sex, robbers having sex with hostages and wait for it the mastermind behind the robbery having sex with the chief inspector in charge of the police operation. The plot has more holes than a second hand dart board. Only the production value and some good set pierces save this from one star. 3/10"

"A band of robbers, lead by a man known simply as 'the Professor', infiltrate and rob the Spanish National Mint. They appear to bungle it, ending up holed up in the Mint with 67 hostages. But it's all part of the Professor's plan. If it succeeds, they'll make off with over $2 billion Euros.Entertaining, initially, and could have been a masterpiece. The initial plot - the plan to secure the Mint and make off with over $2 billion Euros - was very clever and intriguing. It was also engaging: you got to know the individual characters of the heisters, as well as who they were up against. From here on I expected a taught, gritty battle of wits and wills between the robbers and the police.Unfortunately, that didn't happen. Instead of being tight, the plot diverged into silly escapades. One escapade lead to another: robber has to fix some error, fixes it, unwittingly causes another issue, now has to fix that, rinse and repeat. What's worse, the errors, solutions and escapades were incredibly implausible, just being antics for action sake.In addition, having established their characters in the first few episodes, the robbers then do several things counter to their characters. It was as if the writers wrote each scene independent of what had happened before. It could not have been more random if they brought in a different writer for each episode, and told them not to read the scripts of the previous episodes.The further into the series one went, the worse it got. During the first season the good, clever plot developments generally outweighed the random, implausible, stupid ones. By Season Two it was open season, with dumb stuff being the norm. The dumb plot developments became predictable, eg you have a situation where a character has a choice and the logical thing, the thing people would do 100% of the time in real life, is to do A. However, A would mean the series ends, so the character does B, and the series continues.So the plot only makes sense if you're mind-bogglingly stupid.By the end I just wanted it to be over, so my intelligence would no longer be insulted. And yet it still got drawn out, by about 2-3 episodes too many.And apparently there's a Season 3 in the works. Considering how it ended, not sure how that's possible, but the producers did manage to turn what should have been a 8-or-so episode mini-series into a 2-season, 22-episode series."

During the heist they fight among themselves? Forced soap opera level drama in a heist story. Dumbest series ever!"
"I've started watching this as the idea sounded interesting with quite some potential when seeing a series filmed in Europe. But, my God, the characters do loose touch with reality and common sense already during season one. By mid season two I could no longer see this. In all honesty, do we really have to have the \"bad guys\" completely useless when enforcing something, taking revenge or even facing each other? Do we really have all the women in this series falling flat on their backs, in love with the perps? And does the Spanish Police, in real life, act like this? Meaning...will an arrest happen when the perp surrenders as he gets bored from being caught 10x? Another soap opera that disappoints more by creating actually an expectation to get something different..."
"The basic idea of holding mint with hostage was fine and some excitement generated at times and some style. But that's it !!! A low grade stuff besides thatBad direction and complete lack of attention to details. Just some examples:1. Flaw in philosophy: The group is shown as quite innocent who only steals with the justification that big banks steal too. With professor trying to kill inspector's mother, the inspector coming out of coma and group shooting recklessly on police who is doing their job, and then keeping simple people hostage, where is that innocence??2. Technical Flaws:
Biggest one: While the professor is so super intelligent, police seems to be utter stupid that knowing such a big some of money is being stolen, police doesn't have any helicopter on stand-by, nor they lock down the city knowing group is exiting,main inspector taking her boyfriend to crime scene and within the barricaded areamain inspector dating around in an intense operation of 5 daysthe group seems to have everything inside the factory: plush sofas, coffins, candles to decorate the deadhow the hell did they leave the city and the country is never shown with police knowing they are on the run (I guess somehow one has to assume with the great brilliance of the professor, they had a way and the police is anyway stupid)In open firing inside the mint which is happening in an aisle of say 3 meter width, while commandos have shield (and hoping they are experts in encounter) and the group doesn't, not even a single heist member is injured !!!!! Are you kidding me?3. Ridiculous acting and presentation of main characters:
The main inspector in charge of such a big operation shown to be highly unprofessional, weak in character and stupid to take on the criminal alone every timeMost of the gang which is supposedly from not so well off background, has great personality, attitude, drink and eat like they have been taught etiquette, even snobbishness at timesAnd now the funny part: The main inspector being a clear suspect in being accomplice, somehow lives on the life peacefully with no investigation or charges brought on and then leaves the country to Philippines !!!!"

"This series gives a lot of big messages.
First of all, Dali masks are not an ordinary choice. Dali is a genius painter who inherited life that is contrary to popular morality and common customs. He has never accepted the imperatives from the society and the right to wrong moral codes. The masks represent this irregularity.Red overalls represent socialism. The wearers are socialist comrades and fighting. Mint and cops represent capitalism. In capitalism money sets everything. Even morals will set money. So when someone attacks the money, those people are declared bad. When attacked by money, capitalism is waging a war against the attackers with its armed and visual mechanisms.The professor is symbolizing the scientific perspective and accounting. After all, scientific thinking and accountability overcome all kinds of problems. But love succumbs.I have not seen such meaningful socialism for a long time. Moreover, Salvador Dali's tactic was used in the series. You think you are watching the events, but every time you have a deep meaning and message. Ciao Bella is the symbol of socialism.Fabulous work. It's not just a movie or a script. It is a wonderful work as a philosophy. There is a great slap in the capitalist system. 10/10"

From the logic behind the robbery that \"we are not stealing from people but just printing our own money\" is also one of the dumbest logic applied in the history of heist movies/series. Have they even heard of a word \"inflation\"?.

The main inspector in charge of such a big operation shown to be highly unprofessional, weak in character and stupid to take on the criminal alone every timeMost of the gang which is supposedly from not so well off background, has great personality, attitude, drink and eat like they have been taught etiquette, even snobbishness at timesAnd now the funny part: The main inspector being a clear suspect in being accomplice, somehow lives on the life peacefully with no investigation or charges brought on and then leaves the country to Philippines !!!!"

"This series gives a lot of big messages.
First of all, Dali masks are not an ordinary choice. Dali is a genius painter who inherited life that is contrary to popular morality and common customs. He has never accepted the imperatives from the society and the right to wrong moral codes. The masks represent this irregularity.Red overalls represent socialism. The wearers are socialist comrades and fighting. Mint and cops represent capitalism. In capitalism money sets everything. Even morals will set money. So when someone attacks the money, those people are declared bad. When attacked by money, capitalism is waging a war against the attackers with its armed and visual mechanisms.The professor is symbolizing the scientific perspective and accounting. After all, scientific thinking and accountability overcome all kinds of problems. But love succumbs.I have not seen such meaningful socialism for a long time. Moreover, Salvador Dali's tactic was used in the series. You think you are watching the events, but every time you have a deep meaning and message. Ciao Bella is the symbol of socialism.Fabulous work. It's not just a movie or a script. It is a wonderful work as a philosophy. There is a great slap in the capitalist system. 10/10"

From the logic behind the robbery that \"we are not stealing from people but just printing our own money\" is also one of the dumbest logic applied in the history of heist movies/series. Have they even heard of a word \"inflation\"?.

"Like everything in this generation, I discovered this TV show through hype. It was going viral, on my Netflix home screen, on twitter, everywhere. So, I decided to give it a try. I feel disappointed I wasted my time on this show. I'm not a fan of fantasy shows like Spiderman, Superman, Batman etc. Honey Heist is a mirror image of super hero movies, difference being the crew here is a bunch of bad guys. I'm not a fan of fantasy shows because of the imbalance, one side is extremely strong, smart, has all the powers available right on time and other side is simply dumb. In this show too, it's the same, the cops are dumb and incompetent. The cops in this show have all the equipment, fancy gears, intelligence power, yet they screw up worse than a third world country cops, not once but multiple times, come on, are the Spanish cops really that bad? Could the makers not make is somewhat believable? The Royal Mint of Spain is under siege and the top cop is going on a dinner date? Having an affair with the main accused? Oh my, that is some level of soap opera right there. And to top it off they dragged what could have been a mini-series to 4 seasons. Learned my lesson, don't jump on the hype wagon, do your research before wasting time on something like this again."

"I really only write reviews when I feel like a show is getting way too much of praise or way too little.
I love heist movies/series. So it makes sense that I would finally end up watching this one. But let me warn you, other heist lovers, this is a soap opera not a heist story. I'm 6 episodes in now (probably wont be a 7th) and it's just annoying the hell out of me. The characters are unbelievably stupid, doing things that even people like us, who aren't actually career criminals, would never do. And what is the reason for this stupidity? LOVE! Or, maybe I should say crushes? Criminals loving criminals, criminals loving hostages and every other combination. These are people who have lost it all and want everything, and then drop the whole plan and do ridiculous thing when a girl/boy smiles at them sweetly.
I know that I'm very late to reviewing this thing (as it already has multiple seasons) but if my words can save someone 6 hours of their life, it will be worth it. I sadly won't be getting that time back.
it's a 2/10 stars for me (but I put 3/10 believing that people are more likely to ignore the very low score reviews, and I aim to protect you people) :D

"Well to be honest very disappointed in the season, I was waiting for this season since the end of season 3So we started the season inside the bank, ended inside the bank.. and what's the progress? Dead NairobiThat's about it, and I made my peace with Nairobi since last season dead, for some reason they decided to bring her back to life to kill her again at the end of this seasonPunch of hugs, cries and completely unnecessary past scenes that were extremely boringGandia standing in the middle of the hallway surrounded by 4 of them shooting automatic weapons and he still stand, breaks out of his cuffs and leave Rio as if he is going to a picnicSo if you look logically at the season, you gained absolutely nothing from 8 episodes, just unnecessary stretch filled with unnecessary events, scenes and past scenesAn idiot decided to help Gandia out the assassin! As if he didnt know how to break out of his cuffs alone! Then he is back in command again! Forgotten and forgiving! Coffin that would stop an assault! A police man that made no sense after jumping off the 4th storey building to agree to join them and giving them all the Intel they need! And a crazy detective who figures it all out from scenes that were put on repeat that she did not see!End of the day.. very disappointing, stretched out and unnecessary season where they could have ended the story there but yet to wait for another season \"maybe\"In my opinion they could break lisbon out in the first 2 episodes, had the Gandia drama in 1 episode, dropped the bomb over few different episodes insead of cramping them in 1 and ended the story thereAnd what to expect next season? Another stretched out season to finish a series that could have easily be finished this season"
"I had heard so many good things about this show.

"A band of robbers, lead by a man known simply as 'the Professor', infiltrate and rob the Spanish National Mint. They appear to bungle it, ending up holed up in the Mint with 67 hostages. But it's all part of the Professor's plan. If it succeeds, they'll make off with over $2 billion Euros.Entertaining, initially, and could have been a masterpiece. The initial plot - the plan to secure the Mint and make off with over $2 billion Euros - was very clever and intriguing. It was also engaging: you got to know the individual characters of the heisters, as well as who they were up against. From here on I expected a taught, gritty battle of wits and wills between the robbers and the police.Unfortunately, that didn't happen. Instead of being tight, the plot diverged into silly escapades. One escapade lead to another: robber has to fix some error, fixes it, unwittingly causes another issue, now has to fix that, rinse and repeat. What's worse, the errors, solutions and escapades were incredibly implausible, just being antics for action sake.In addition, having established their characters in the first few episodes, the robbers then do several things counter to their characters. It was as if the writers wrote each scene independent of what had happened before. It could not have been more random if they brought in a different writer for each episode, and told them not to read the scripts of the previous episodes.The further into the series one went, the worse it got. During the first season the good, clever plot developments generally outweighed the random, implausible, stupid ones. By Season Two it was open season, with dumb stuff being the norm. The dumb plot developments became predictable, eg you have a situation where a character has a choice and the logical thing, the thing people would do 100% of the time in real life, is to do A. However, A would mean the series ends, so the character does B, and the series continues.So the plot only makes sense if you're mind-bogglingly stupid.By the end I just wanted it to be over, so my intelligence would no longer be insulted. And yet it still got drawn out, by about 2-3 episodes too many.And apparently there's a Season 3 in the works. Considering how it ended, not sure how that's possible, but the producers did manage to turn what should have been a 8-or-so episode mini-series into a 2-season, 22-episode series."

During the heist they fight among themselves? Forced soap opera level drama in a heist story. Dumbest series ever!"
"I've started watching this as the idea sounded interesting with quite some potential when seeing a series filmed in Europe. But, my God, the characters do loose touch with reality and common sense already during season one. By mid season two I could no longer see this. In all honesty, do we really have to have the \"bad guys\" completely useless when enforcing something, taking revenge or even facing each other? Do we really have all the women in this series falling flat on their backs, in love with the perps? And does the Spanish Police, in real life, act like this? Meaning...will an arrest happen when the perp surrenders as he gets bored from being caught 10x? Another soap opera that disappoints more by creating actually an expectation to get something different..."
"The basic idea of holding mint with hostage was fine and some excitement generated at times and some style. But that's it !!! A low grade stuff besides thatBad direction and complete lack of attention to details. Just some examples:1. Flaw in philosophy: The group is shown as quite innocent who only steals with the justification that big banks steal too. With professor trying to kill inspector's mother, the inspector coming out of coma and group shooting recklessly on police who is doing their job, and then keeping simple people hostage, where is that innocence??2. Technical Flaws:
Biggest one: While the professor is so super intelligent, police seems to be utter stupid that knowing such a big some of money is being stolen, police doesn't have any helicopter on stand-by, nor they lock down the city knowing group is exiting,main inspector taking her boyfriend to crime scene and within the barricaded areamain inspector dating around in an intense operation of 5 daysthe group seems to have everything inside the factory: plush sofas, coffins, candles to decorate the deadhow the hell did they leave the city and the country is never shown with police knowing they are on the run (I guess somehow one has to assume with the great brilliance of the professor, they had a way and the police is anyway stupid)In open firing inside the mint which is happening in an aisle of say 3 meter width, while commandos have shield (and hoping they are experts in encounter) and the group doesn't, not even a single heist member is injured !!!!!

The initial plot - the plan to secure the Mint and make off with over $2 billion Euros - was very clever and intriguing. It was also engaging: you got to know the individual characters of the heisters, as well as who they were up against. From here on I expected a taught, gritty battle of wits and wills between the robbers and the police.Unfortunately, that didn't happen. Instead of being tight, the plot diverged into silly escapades. One escapade lead to another: robber has to fix some error, fixes it, unwittingly causes another issue, now has to fix that, rinse and repeat. What's worse, the errors, solutions and escapades were incredibly implausible, just being antics for action sake.In addition, having established their characters in the first few episodes, the robbers then do several things counter to their characters. It was as if the writers wrote each scene independent of what had happened before. It could not have been more random if they brought in a different writer for each episode, and told them not to read the scripts of the previous episodes.The further into the series one went, the worse it got. During the first season the good, clever plot developments generally outweighed the random, implausible, stupid ones. By Season Two it was open season, with dumb stuff being the norm. The dumb plot developments became predictable, eg you have a situation where a character has a choice and the logical thing, the thing people would do 100% of the time in real life, is to do A. However, A would mean the series ends, so the character does B, and the series continues.So the plot only makes sense if you're mind-bogglingly stupid.By the end I just wanted it to be over, so my intelligence would no longer be insulted. And yet it still got drawn out, by about 2-3 episodes too many.And apparently there's a Season 3 in the works. Considering how it ended, not sure how that's possible, but the producers did manage to turn what should have been a 8-or-so episode mini-series into a 2-season, 22-episode series."

"I really dont get it, what do these high ratings see in this series. This is the most dumbest heist i have ever seen. You plan something for years, you train people for months and then what? During the heist they fight among themselves? Forced soap opera level drama in a heist story. Dumbest series ever!"
"I've started watching this as the idea sounded interesting with quite some potential when seeing a series filmed in Europe. But, my God, the characters do loose touch with reality and common sense already during season one. By mid season two I could no longer see this. In all honesty, do we really have to have the \"bad guys\" completely useless when enforcing something, taking revenge or even facing each other? Do we really have all the women in this series falling flat on their backs, in love with the perps? And does the Spanish Police, in real life, act like this? Meaning...will an arrest happen when the perp surrenders as he gets bored from being caught 10x? Another soap opera that disappoints more by creating actually an expectation to get something different..."
"The basic idea of holding mint with hostage was fine and some excitement generated at times and some style. But that's it !!! A low grade stuff besides thatBad direction and complete lack of attention to details. Just some examples:1. Flaw in philosophy: The group is shown as quite innocent who only steals with the justification that big banks steal too. With professor trying to kill inspector's mother, the inspector coming out of coma and group shooting recklessly on police who is doing their job, and then keeping simple people hostage, where is that innocence??2. Technical Flaws:
Biggest one: While the professor is so super intelligent, police seems to be utter stupid that knowing such a big some of money is being stolen, police doesn't have any helicopter on stand-by, nor they lock down the city knowing group is exiting,main inspector taking her boyfriend to crime scene and within the barricaded areamain inspector dating around in an intense operation of 5 daysthe group seems to have everything inside the factory: plush sofas, coffins, candles to decorate the deadhow the hell did they leave the city and the country is never shown with police knowing they are on the run (I guess somehow one has to assume with the great brilliance of the professor, they had a way and the police is anyway stupid)In open firing inside the mint which is happening in an aisle of say 3 meter width, while commandos have shield (and hoping they are experts in encounter) and the group doesn't, not even a single heist member is injured !!!!! Are you kidding me?3. Ridiculous acting and presentation of main characters:
The main inspector in charge of such a big operation shown to be highly unprofessional, weak in character and stupid to take on the criminal alone every timeMost of the gang which is supposedly from not so well off background, has great personality, attitude, drink and eat like they have been taught etiquette, even snobbishness at timesAnd now the funny part: The main inspector being a clear suspect in being accomplice, somehow lives on the life peacefully with no investigation or charges brought on and then leaves the country to Philippines !!!!"

"This series gives a lot of big messages.
First of all, Dali masks are not an ordinary choice. Dali is a genius painter who inherited life that is contrary to popular morality and common customs. He has never accepted the imperatives from the society and the right to wrong moral codes. The masks represent this irregularity.Red overalls represent socialism. The wearers are socialist comrades and fighting. Mint and cops represent capitalism. In capitalism money sets everything. Even morals will set money. So when someone attacks the money, those people are declared bad. When attacked by money, capitalism is waging a war against the attackers with its armed and visual mechanisms.The professor is symbolizing the scientific perspective and accounting. After all, scientific thinking and accountability overcome all kinds of problems. But love succumbs.I have not seen such meaningful socialism for a long time. Moreover, Salvador Dali's tactic was used in the series. You think you are watching the events, but every time you have a deep meaning and message. Ciao Bella is the symbol of socialism.Fabulous work. It's not just a movie or a script. It is a wonderful work as a philosophy. There is a great slap in the capitalist system. 10/10"

"The real heist is by the writers who keep stalling for more time with more nonsense episodes while Netflix prints money.First season had promise. But shortly into the season characters start making flatout preternatural connections especially inspector Raquel.

If we still had TV guide this show would be on at 11 am after \"the View.\" I got fooled because they didn't shoot it in live camera format with dramatic face to face pauses, watery eyes, and breakaways to commercial (remember those). Music is pretty good.

"Like everything in this generation, I discovered this TV show through hype. It was going viral, on my Netflix home screen, on twitter, everywhere. So, I decided to give it a try. I feel disappointed I wasted my time on this show. I'm not a fan of fantasy shows like Spiderman, Superman, Batman etc. Honey Heist is a mirror image of super hero movies, difference being the crew here is a bunch of bad guys. I'm not a fan of fantasy shows because of the imbalance, one side is extremely strong, smart, has all the powers available right on time and other side is simply dumb. In this show too, it's the same, the cops are dumb and incompetent. The cops in this show have all the equipment, fancy gears, intelligence power, yet they screw up worse than a third world country cops, not once but multiple times, come on, are the Spanish cops really that bad? Could the makers not make is somewhat believable? The Royal Mint of Spain is under siege and the top cop is going on a dinner date? Having an affair with the main accused? Oh my, that is some level of soap opera right there. And to top it off they dragged what could have been a mini-series to 4 seasons.

"I really only write reviews when I feel like a show is getting way too much of praise or way too little.
I love heist movies/series. So it makes sense that I would finally end up watching this one. But let me warn you, other heist lovers, this is a soap opera not a heist story. I'm 6 episodes in now (probably wont be a 7th) and it's just annoying the hell out of me. The characters are unbelievably stupid, doing things that even people like us, who aren't actually career criminals, would never do. And what is the reason for this stupidity? LOVE! Or, maybe I should say crushes? Criminals loving criminals, criminals loving hostages and every other combination. These are people who have lost it all and want everything, and then drop the whole plan and do ridiculous thing when a girl/boy smiles at them sweetly.
I know that I'm very late to reviewing this thing (as it already has multiple seasons) but if my words can save someone 6 hours of their life, it will be worth it. I sadly won't be getting that time back.
it's a 2/10 stars for me (but I put 3/10 believing that people are more likely to ignore the very low score reviews, and I aim to protect you people) :D

"Well to be honest very disappointed in the season, I was waiting for this season since the end of season 3So we started the season inside the bank, ended inside the bank.. and what's the progress? Dead NairobiThat's about it, and I made my peace with Nairobi since last season dead, for some reason they decided to bring her back to life to kill her again at the end of this seasonPunch of hugs, cries and completely unnecessary past scenes that were extremely boringGandia standing in the middle of the hallway surrounded by 4 of them shooting automatic weapons and he still stand, breaks out of his cuffs and leave Rio as if he is going to a picnicSo if you look logically at the season, you gained absolutely nothing from 8 episodes, just unnecessary stretch filled with unnecessary events, scenes and past scenesAn idiot decided to help Gandia out the assassin! As if he didnt know how to break out of his cuffs alone! Then he is back in command again! Forgotten and forgiving! Coffin that would stop an assault! A police man that made no sense after jumping off the 4th storey building to agree to join them and giving them all the Intel they need! And a crazy detective who figures it all out from scenes that were put on repeat that she did not see!End of the day.. very disappointing, stretched out and unnecessary season where they could have ended the story there but yet to wait for another season \"maybe\"In my opinion they could break lisbon out in the first 2 episodes, had the Gandia drama in 1 episode, dropped the bomb over few different episodes insead of cramping them in 1 and ended the story thereAnd what to expect next season? Another stretched out season to finish a series that could have easily be finished this season"
"I had heard so many good things about this show. The most watched show in Europe, Spain's biggest ever viewing figures etc. Then from a promising start the program just gets more and more ridiculous. Now I know it's just apiece of entertaining fictional drama but half the skill in making a show like this is to get the audience to think as far fetched as the plot is a part of you would like to think it could be done.The show makes the perpetrators and the police look as stupid and as dumb as each other. You get robbers falling in love and having sex, robbers having sex with hostages and wait for it the mastermind behind the robbery having sex with the chief inspector in charge of the police operation. The plot has more holes than a second hand dart board. Only the production value and some good set pierces save this from one star. 3/10"

Dead NairobiThat's about it, and I made my peace with Nairobi since last season dead, for some reason they decided to bring her back to life to kill her again at the end of this seasonPunch of hugs, cries and completely unnecessary past scenes that were extremely boringGandia standing in the middle of the hallway surrounded by 4 of them shooting automatic weapons and he still stand, breaks out of his cuffs and leave Rio as if he is going to a picnicSo if you look logically at the season, you gained absolutely nothing from 8 episodes, just unnecessary stretch filled with unnecessary events, scenes and past scenesAn idiot decided to help Gandia out the assassin! As if he didnt know how to break out of his cuffs alone! Then he is back in command again! Forgotten and forgiving! Coffin that would stop an assault! A police man that made no sense after jumping off the 4th storey building to agree to join them and giving them all the Intel they need! And a crazy detective who figures it all out from scenes that were put on repeat that she did not see!End of the day.. very disappointing, stretched out and unnecessary season where they could have ended the story there but yet to wait for another season \"maybe\"In my opinion they could break lisbon out in the first 2 episodes, had the Gandia drama in 1 episode, dropped the bomb over few different episodes insead of cramping them in 1 and ended the story thereAnd what to expect next season? Another stretched out season to finish a series that could have easily be finished this season"
"I had heard so many good things about this show. The most watched show in Europe, Spain's biggest ever viewing figures etc. Then from a promising start the program just gets more and more ridiculous. Now I know it's just apiece of entertaining fictional drama but half the skill in making a show like this is to get the audience to think as far fetched as the plot is a part of you would like to think it could be done.The show makes the perpetrators and the police look as stupid and as dumb as each other. You get robbers falling in love and having sex, robbers having sex with hostages and wait for it the mastermind behind the robbery having sex with the chief inspector in charge of the police operation. The plot has more holes than a second hand dart board. Only the production value and some good set pierces save this from one star. 3/10"

"With a 100% positive critics rating on Rotten Tomatoes and with many of my friends going crazy for it, my opition might not be very popular. But I find La Casa de Papel (Money Heist) to be utterly ridiculous, overly melodramatic and just plain stupid."

"Professor what are we robbing in season 3-4-5? Professor: People Will think we are robbing the bank of Spain, However wee are actually going to rob the viewers of their time, we will insult their intellect with every scene and episode, make them cringe and want to kill themselves with unnecessary gay drama, show them some of the most unrealistic action the world has seen. And that way we will rob them of their time. THE BIGGEST HEIST IN MANKID!!!!!"

"A band of robbers, lead by a man known simply as 'the Professor', infiltrate and rob the Spanish National Mint. They appear to bungle it, ending up holed up in the Mint with 67 hostages. But it's all part of the Professor's plan. If it succeeds, they'll make off with over $2 billion Euros.Entertaining, initially, and could have been a masterpiece. The initial plot - the plan to secure the Mint and make off with over $2 billion Euros - was very clever and intriguing. It was also engaging: you got to know the individual characters of the heisters, as well as who they were up against. From here on I expected a taught, gritty battle of wits and wills between the robbers and the police.Unfortunately, that didn't happen. Instead of being tight, the plot diverged into silly escapades. One escapade lead to another: robber has to fix some error, fixes it, unwittingly causes another issue, now has to fix that, rinse and repeat. What's worse, the errors, solutions and escapades were incredibly implausible, just being antics for action sake.In addition, having established their characters in the first few episodes, the robbers then do several things counter to their characters. It was as if the writers wrote each scene independent of what had happened before. It could not have been more random if they brought in a different writer for each episode, and told them not to read the scripts of the previous episodes.The further into the series one went, the worse it got. During the first season the good, clever plot developments generally outweighed the random, implausible, stupid ones. By Season Two it was open season, with dumb stuff being the norm. The dumb plot developments became predictable, eg you have a situation where a character has a choice and the logical thing, the thing people would do 100% of the time in real life, is to do A. However, A would mean the series ends, so the character does B, and the series continues.So the plot only makes sense if you're mind-bogglingly stupid.By the end I just wanted it to be over, so my intelligence would no longer be insulted. And yet it still got drawn out, by about 2-3 episodes too many.And apparently there's a Season 3 in the works. Considering how it ended, not sure how that's possible, but the producers did manage to turn what should have been a 8-or-so episode mini-series into a 2-season, 22-episode series."

"I really dont get it, what do these high ratings see in this series. This is the most dumbest heist i have ever seen. You plan something for years, you train people for months and then what? During the heist they fight among themselves? Forced soap opera level drama in a heist story. Dumbest series ever!"
"I've started watching this as the idea sounded interesting with quite some potential when seeing a series filmed in Europe. But, my God, the characters do loose touch with reality and common sense already during season one. By mid season two I could no longer see this. In all honesty, do we really have to have the \"bad guys\" completely useless when enforcing something, taking revenge or even facing each other? Do we really have all the women in this series falling flat on their backs, in love with the perps? And does the Spanish Police, in real life, act like this? Meaning...will an arrest happen when the perp surrenders as he gets bored from being caught 10x? Another soap opera that disappoints more by creating actually an expectation to get something different..."
"The basic idea of holding mint with hostage was fine and some excitement generated at times and some style. But that's it !!! A low grade stuff besides thatBad direction and complete lack of attention to details. Just some examples:1. Flaw in philosophy: The group is shown as quite innocent who only steals with the justification that big banks steal too. With professor trying to kill inspector's mother, the inspector coming out of coma and group shooting recklessly on police who is doing their job, and then keeping simple people hostage, where is that innocence??2. Technical Flaws:
Biggest one: While the professor is so super intelligent, police seems to be utter stupid that knowing such a big some of money is being stolen, police doesn't have any helicopter on stand-by, nor they lock down the city knowing group is exiting,main inspector taking her boyfriend to crime scene and within the barricaded areamain inspector dating around in an intense operation of 5 daysthe group seems to have everything inside the factory: plush sofas, coffins, candles to decorate the deadhow the hell did they leave the city and the country is never shown with police knowing they are on the run (I guess somehow one has to assume with the great brilliance of the professor, they had a way and the police is anyway stupid)In open firing inside the mint which is happening in an aisle of say 3 meter width, while commandos have shield (and hoping they are experts in encounter) and the group doesn't, not even a single heist member is injured !!!!! Are you kidding me?3. Ridiculous acting and presentation of main characters:
The main inspector in charge of such a big operation shown to be highly unprofessional, weak in character and stupid to take on the criminal alone every timeMost of the gang which is supposedly from not so well off background, has great personality, attitude, drink and eat like they have been taught etiquette, even snobbishness at timesAnd now the funny part: The main inspector being a clear suspect in being accomplice, somehow lives on the life peacefully with no investigation or charges brought on and then leaves the country to Philippines !!!!"

"This series gives a lot of big messages.
First of all, Dali masks are not an ordinary choice. Dali is a genius painter who inherited life that is contrary to popular morality and common customs. He has never accepted the imperatives from the society and the right to wrong moral codes. The masks represent this irregularity.Red overalls represent socialism. The wearers are socialist comrades and fighting. Mint and cops represent capitalism. In capitalism money sets everything. Even morals will set money. So when someone attacks the money, those people are declared bad. When attacked by money, capitalism is waging a war against the attackers with its armed and visual mechanisms.The professor is symbolizing the scientific perspective and accounting. After all, scientific thinking and accountability overcome all kinds of problems. But love succumbs.I have not seen such meaningful socialism for a long time. Moreover, Salvador Dali's tactic was used in the series. You think you are watching the events, but every time you have a deep meaning and message. Ciao Bella is the symbol of socialism.Fabulous work. It's not just a movie or a script. It is a wonderful work as a philosophy. There is a great slap in the capitalist system. 10/10"

From the logic behind the robbery that \"we are not stealing from people but just printing our own money\" is also one of the dumbest logic applied in the history of heist movies/series. Have they even heard of a word \"inflation\"?.

"The real heist is by the writers who keep stalling for more time with more nonsense episodes while Netflix prints money.First season had promise. But shortly into the season characters start making flatout preternatural connections especially inspector Raquel.

"Like everything in this generation, I discovered this TV show through hype. It was going viral, on my Netflix home screen, on twitter, everywhere. So, I decided to give it a try. I feel disappointed I wasted my time on this show. I'm not a fan of fantasy shows like Spiderman, Superman, Batman etc. Honey Heist is a mirror image of super hero movies, difference being the crew here is a bunch of bad guys. I'm not a fan of fantasy shows because of the imbalance, one side is extremely strong, smart, has all the powers available right on time and other side is simply dumb. In this show too, it's the same, the cops are dumb and incompetent. The cops in this show have all the equipment, fancy gears, intelligence power, yet they screw up worse than a third world country cops, not once but multiple times, come on, are the Spanish cops really that bad? Could the makers not make is somewhat believable? The Royal Mint of Spain is under siege and the top cop is going on a dinner date? Having an affair with the main accused? Oh my, that is some level of soap opera right there. And to top it off they dragged what could have been a mini-series to 4 seasons. Learned my lesson, don't jump on the hype wagon, do your research before wasting time on something like this again."

Season 3 was just a \"remake\" of season 1 but, my God, season 4 is an awful soap opera...seems almost like a \"filler\" season...no actual plot, no actual action...you could skip straight to episode 7 if u want and still..you wouldnt miss a thing.

"I really only write reviews when I feel like a show is getting way too much of praise or way too little.
I love heist movies/series. So it makes sense that I would finally end up watching this one. But let me warn you, other heist lovers, this is a soap opera not a heist story. I'm 6 episodes in now (probably wont be a 7th) and it's just annoying the hell out of me. The characters are unbelievably stupid, doing things that even people like us, who aren't actually career criminals, would never do. And what is the reason for this stupidity? LOVE! Or, maybe I should say crushes? Criminals loving criminals, criminals loving hostages and every other combination. These are people who have lost it all and want everything, and then drop the whole plan and do ridiculous thing when a girl/boy smiles at them sweetly.
I know that I'm very late to reviewing this thing (as it already has multiple seasons) but if my words can save someone 6 hours of their life, it will be worth it. I sadly won't be getting that time back.
it's a 2/10 stars for me (but I put 3/10 believing that people are more likely to ignore the very low score reviews, and I aim to protect you people) :D

The cops in this show have all the equipment, fancy gears, intelligence power, yet they screw up worse than a third world country cops, not once but multiple times, come on, are the Spanish cops really that bad? Could the makers not make is somewhat believable? The Royal Mint of Spain is under siege and the top cop is going on a dinner date? Having an affair with the main accused? Oh my, that is some level of soap opera right there. And to top it off they dragged what could have been a mini-series to 4 seasons. Learned my lesson, don't jump on the hype wagon, do your research before wasting time on something like this again."

"I'm not sure why this show is highly rated. Really disappointing. Had a good concept for a storyline but the it felt like it was directed in the 80s. Superficial dialogue and character relationships. Every opportunity to exploit the female characters is taken. Lots if man-handling and over sexualisation. It's all a bit cheap."

"Well, the writers and producers outdone themselves.
They started with a good idea, intriguing characters and an elaborate plot.
By the end of season 2 it became apparent they could not drag this anymore.
Season 3 was just a \"remake\" of season 1 but, my God, season 4 is an awful soap opera...seems almost like a \"filler\" season...no actual plot, no actual action...you could skip straight to episode 7 if u want and still..you wouldnt miss a thing.
Hire better writers, because this cast is impeccable."

"I really only write reviews when I feel like a show is getting way too much of praise or way too little.
I love heist movies/series. So it makes sense that I would finally end up watching this one. But let me warn you, other heist lovers, this is a soap opera not a heist story. I'm 6 episodes in now (probably wont be a 7th) and it's just annoying the hell out of me. The characters are unbelievably stupid, doing things that even people like us, who aren't actually career criminals, would never do. And what is the reason for this stupidity? LOVE! Or, maybe I should say crushes? Criminals loving criminals, criminals loving hostages and every other combination. These are people who have lost it all and want everything, and then drop the whole plan and do ridiculous thing when a girl/boy smiles at them sweetly.
I know that I'm very late to reviewing this thing (as it already has multiple seasons) but if my words can save someone 6 hours of their life, it will be worth it. I sadly won't be getting that time back.
it's a 2/10 stars for me (but I put 3/10 believing that people are more likely to ignore the very low score reviews, and I aim to protect you people) :D
Take care! :)"

"Well to be honest very disappointed in the season, I was waiting for this season since the end of season 3So we started the season inside the bank, ended inside the bank.. and what's the progress? Dead NairobiThat's about it, and I made my peace with Nairobi since last season dead, for some reason they decided to bring her back to life to kill her again at the end of this seasonPunch of hugs, cries and completely unnecessary past scenes that were extremely boringGandia standing in the middle of the hallway surrounded by 4 of them shooting automatic weapons and he still stand, breaks out of his cuffs and leave Rio as if he is going to a picnicSo if you look logically at the season, you gained absolutely nothing from 8 episodes, just unnecessary stretch filled with unnecessary events, scenes and past scenesAn idiot decided to help Gandia out the assassin! As if he didnt know how to break out of his cuffs alone! Then he is back in command again! Forgotten and forgiving! Coffin that would stop an assault! A police man that made no sense after jumping off the 4th storey building to agree to join them and giving them all the Intel they need! And a crazy detective who figures it all out from scenes that were put on repeat that she did not see!End of the day.. very disappointing, stretched out and unnecessary season where they could have ended the story there but yet to wait for another season \"maybe\"In my opinion they could break lisbon out in the first 2 episodes, had the Gandia drama in 1 episode, dropped the bomb over few different episodes insead of cramping them in 1 and ended the story thereAnd what to expect next season? Another stretched out season to finish a series that could have easily be finished this season"
"I had heard so many good things about this show. The most watched show in Europe, Spain's biggest ever viewing figures etc. Then from a promising start the program just gets more and more ridiculous. Now I know it's just apiece of entertaining fictional drama but half the skill in making a show like this is to get the audience to think as far fetched as the plot is a part of you would like to think it could be done.The show makes the perpetrators and the police look as stupid and as dumb as each other. You get robbers falling in love and having sex, robbers having sex with hostages and wait for it the mastermind behind the robbery having sex with the chief inspector in charge of the police operation. The plot has more holes than a second hand dart board. Only the production value and some good set pierces save this from one star. 3/10"

"With a 100% positive critics rating on Rotten Tomatoes and with many of my friends going crazy for it, my opition might not be very popular. But I find La Casa de Papel (Money Heist) to be utterly ridiculous, overly melodramatic and just plain stupid."

"Professor what are we robbing in season 3-4-5? Professor: People Will think we are robbing the bank of Spain, However wee are actually going to rob the viewers of their time, we will insult their intellect with every scene and episode, make them cringe and want to kill themselves with unnecessary gay drama, show them some of the most unrealistic action the world has seen. And that way we will rob them of their time. THE BIGGEST HEIST IN MANKID!!!!!"

"A band of robbers, lead by a man known simply as 'the Professor', infiltrate and rob the Spanish National Mint. They appear to bungle it, ending up holed up in the Mint with 67 hostages. But it's all part of the Professor's plan. If it succeeds, they'll make off with over $2 billion Euros.Entertaining, initially, and could have been a masterpiece. The initial plot - the plan to secure the Mint and make off with over $2 billion Euros - was very clever and intriguing. It was also engaging: you got to know the individual characters of the heisters, as well as who they were up against. From here on I expected a taught, gritty battle of wits and wills between the robbers and the police.Unfortunately, that didn't happen. Instead of being tight, the plot diverged into silly escapades. One escapade lead to another: robber has to fix some error, fixes it, unwittingly causes another issue, now has to fix that, rinse and repeat. What's worse, the errors, solutions and escapades were incredibly implausible, just being antics for action sake.In addition, having established their characters in the first few episodes, the robbers then do several things counter to their characters. It was as if the writers wrote each scene independent of what had happened before. It could not have been more random if they brought in a different writer for each episode, and told them not to read the scripts of the previous episodes.The further into the series one went, the worse it got. During the first season the good, clever plot developments generally outweighed the random, implausible, stupid ones. By Season Two it was open season, with dumb stuff being the norm. The dumb plot developments became predictable, eg you have a situation where a character has a choice and the logical thing, the thing people would do 100% of the time in real life, is to do A. However, A would mean the series ends, so the character does B, and the series continues.So the plot only makes sense if you're mind-bogglingly stupid.By the end I just wanted it to be over, so my intelligence would no longer be insulted. And yet it still got drawn out, by about 2-3 episodes too many.And apparently there's a Season 3 in the works. Considering how it ended, not sure how that's possible, but the producers did manage to turn what should have been a 8-or-so episode mini-series into a 2-season, 22-episode series."

"I really dont get it, what do these high ratings see in this series. This is the most dumbest heist i have ever seen. You plan something for years, you train people for months and then what? During the heist they fight among themselves? Forced soap opera level drama in a heist story. Dumbest series ever!"
"I've started watching this as the idea sounded interesting with quite some potential when seeing a series filmed in Europe. But, my God, the characters do loose touch with reality and common sense already during season one. By mid season two I could no longer see this. In all honesty, do we really have to have the \"bad guys\" completely useless when enforcing something, taking revenge or even facing each other? Do we really have all the women in this series falling flat on their backs, in love with the perps? And does the Spanish Police, in real life, act like this? Meaning...will an arrest happen when the perp surrenders as he gets bored from being caught 10x? Another soap opera that disappoints more by creating actually an expectation to get something different..."
"The basic idea of holding mint with hostage was fine and some excitement generated at times and some style. But that's it !!! A low grade stuff besides thatBad direction and complete lack of attention to details. Just some examples:1. Flaw in philosophy: The group is shown as quite innocent who only steals with the justification that big banks steal too. With professor trying to kill inspector's mother, the inspector coming out of coma and group shooting recklessly on police who is doing their job, and then keeping simple people hostage, where is that innocence??2. Technical Flaws:
Biggest one: While the professor is so super intelligent, police seems to be utter stupid that knowing such a big some of money is being stolen, police doesn't have any helicopter on stand-by, nor they lock down the city knowing group is exiting,main inspector taking her boyfriend to crime scene and within the barricaded areamain inspector dating around in an intense operation of 5 daysthe group seems to have everything inside the factory: plush sofas, coffins, candles to decorate the deadhow the hell did they leave the city and the country is never shown with police knowing they are on the run (I guess somehow one has to assume with the great brilliance of the professor, they had a way and the police is anyway stupid)In open firing inside the mint which is happening in an aisle of say 3 meter width, while commandos have shield (and hoping they are experts in encounter) and the group doesn't, not even a single heist member is injured !!!!! Are you kidding me?3. Ridiculous acting and presentation of main characters:
The main inspector in charge of such a big operation shown to be highly unprofessional, weak in character and stupid to take on the criminal alone every timeMost of the gang which is supposedly from not so well off background, has great personality, attitude, drink and eat like they have been taught etiquette, even snobbishness at timesAnd now the funny part: The main inspector being a clear suspect in being accomplice, somehow lives on the life peacefully with no investigation or charges brought on and then leaves the country to Philippines !!!!"

"This series gives a lot of big messages.
First of all, Dali masks are not an ordinary choice. Dali is a genius painter who inherited life that is contrary to popular morality and common customs. He has never accepted the imperatives from the society and the right to wrong moral codes. The masks represent this irregularity.Red overalls represent socialism. The wearers are socialist comrades and fighting. Mint and cops represent capitalism. In capitalism money sets everything. Even morals will set money. So when someone attacks the money, those people are declared bad. When attacked by money, capitalism is waging a war against the attackers with its armed and visual mechanisms.The professor is symbolizing the scientific perspective and accounting. After all, scientific thinking and accountability overcome all kinds of problems. But love succumbs.I have not seen such meaningful socialism for a long time. Moreover, Salvador Dali's tactic was used in the series. You think you are watching the events, but every time you have a deep meaning and message. Ciao Bella is the symbol of socialism.Fabulous work. It's not just a movie or a script. It is a wonderful work as a philosophy. There is a great slap in the capitalist system. 10/10"

"Is Spanish police/administration this dumb as shown in the series then 'god help them'.
From the logic behind the robbery that \"we are not stealing from people but just printing our own money\" is also one of the dumbest logic applied in the history of heist movies/series. Have they even heard of a word \"inflation\"?.
I wasted my 10- 15 hrs watching season 1 and 2.
If you are a guy/girl who watches lot of quality movies/series then please don't waste you time on this."

"The real heist is by the writers who keep stalling for more time with more nonsense episodes while Netflix prints money.First season had promise. But shortly into the season characters start making flatout preternatural connections especially inspector Raquel. Which she corrects by missing the most obvious ones. 6 episodes in... coming out of a hazy binge stupor because your wife keeps pressing next... you realize... wait... they expect us to believe all this happens in 3 days. People recover from gunshot wounds as if they were scratches. Of course, everyone forgives and forgets. Love stories happen when someones sneezes. Investigations are mobilized across all of Spain with such immediacy and the realtime forensics of our dreams. Then the typical \"we have the all important lab results - i knew he was the guy - but your voicemail is now full - and I'm the jaded drunk lover about to have an accident/coma routine - let me call your selectively Alzheimers mother.\" If only his twin would show up.... Professor Palpatine's plan then everything would be proceeding as he's forseen. If we still had TV guide this show would be on at 11 am after \"the View.\" I got fooled because they didn't shoot it in live camera format with dramatic face to face pauses, watery eyes, and breakaways to commercial (remember those). Music is pretty good. I can go on... but then I would be an accomplice perpetuating the real crime of taking your time with this show (like the writers!)Watch no more than two episodes to get the gist/hype then make your escape!"
"Like everything in this generation, I discovered this TV show through hype. It was going viral, on my Netflix home screen, on twitter, everywhere. So, I decided to give it a try. I feel disappointed I wasted my time on this show.
